# Iris Flower Classification  

ðŸŒ¸ Project Type: Machine Learning Classification  
ðŸŒ¸ Dataset: Iris Dataset from scikit-learn  
ðŸŒ¸ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  

## Overview  
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species- Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using supervised machine learning. The classification is based on four features:  
ðŸŒ¸ Sepal Length  
ðŸŒ¸Sepal Width  
ðŸŒ¸Petal Length  
ðŸŒ¸Petal Width  
We go from data loading and exploration, to visualization, model training, evaluation, and final prediction.  

## Objectives  
ðŸŒ¸ Understand and explore the Iris dataset  
ðŸŒ¸Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
ðŸŒ¸Visualize key patterns and distributions  
ðŸŒ¸Build and compare ML models: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree  
ðŸŒ¸Use K-Fold cross-validation for fair performance comparison  
ðŸŒ¸Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report  
ðŸŒ¸Make predictions on new data

## Project files  
This repository contains two main files for the Iris Flower Classification project:  
ðŸŒ¸ iris_classification.ipynb  
    This is the Jupyter Notebook version of the project. Contains step-by-step code with explanations, visualizations, and output. Run it in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code (with the Jupyter extension).  
ðŸŒ¸ iris_classification.py
    This is the Python script version of the project. Contains the same code as the notebook, but without the markdown explanations.

## Final Thoughts  
This project helped me practice the full machine learning workflow-from data loading and EDA, to model building and evaluation. It highlighted the importance of both intuition from visualizations and it also taught me that simple models can still deliver powerful results when the data is well-understood.
